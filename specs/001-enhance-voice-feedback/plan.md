# Implementation Plan: 语音反馈和翻译增强

**Branch**: `001-enhance-voice-feedback` | **Date**: 2025-10-19 | **Spec**: /Users/ping/Documents/code/cc-sdd-wordpet/specs/001-enhance-voice-feedback/spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Implementation of voice feedback and translation enhancement features for the WordPet application. This feature will improve user experience by adding pronunciation on word click, sound effects on correct answers, and translation display after successful sentence completion. The implementation will follow WordPet's core principles of child-first design and lightweight architecture.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)  
**Primary Dependencies**: Web Speech API for TTS functionality, existing WordPet codebase  
**Storage**: LocalStorage for user settings (TTS enable/disable, volume)  
**Testing**: Manual testing with potential for automated UI tests in future  
**Target Platform**: Web browsers (PWA-compatible) supporting modern web standards
**Project Type**: Single-page application (SPA) enhancement  
**Performance Goals**: Sub-500ms response to word clicks for pronunciation, <1 second for translation display  
**Constraints**: Lightweight implementation to maintain app performance, offline functionality  
**Scale/Scope**: Enhancement to existing WordPet game mechanics, focusing on pronunciation and translation features

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

Constitution alignment verification:
- Child-First Design: Implementation must prioritize clear pronunciation and age-appropriate translations for 6-12 year olds ✓ RESOLVED
- Low-Friction Learning: Ensure pronunciation and translation enhance rather than hinder learning flow ✓ RESOLVED
- Lightweight Architecture: Implementation must not significantly increase bundle size or impact performance ✓ RESOLVED
- Gamified Engagement: Sound effects must enhance engagement without becoming distracting ✓ RESOLVED
- Responsible Usage: Features must not encourage excessive usage or cause hearing fatigue ✓ RESOLVED

### Source Code (repository root)

```
# WordPet Project Structure (Enhancement to existing)
index.html              # No changes needed
style.css              # Minor additions for translation display styling
game.js                # Enhanced with word click pronunciation logic
data.js                # Potentially enhanced for translation storage
pet.js                 # No changes needed
utils.js               # Enhanced with TTS utility functions
```

**Structure Decision**: The voice feedback and translation enhancement will be implemented as modifications to existing WordPet files rather than new components, maintaining the lightweight architecture principle.

## Phase Completion Status

### Phase 0: Outline & Research
- [x] Extract unknowns from Technical Context
- [x] Generate research findings in `research.md`
- [x] Resolve all NEEDS CLARIFICATION items
- [x] Document technology decisions and rationale

### Phase 1: Design & Contracts  
- [x] Extract entities and create `data-model.md`
- [x] Generate API contracts in `/contracts/` 
- [x] Create `quickstart.md` guide
- [x] Update agent context with `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh`

## Next Steps

Pending completion of Phase 0 research and Phase 1 design. The implementation plan will be updated as research and design phases are completed.
