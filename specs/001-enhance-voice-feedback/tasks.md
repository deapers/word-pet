# Task Breakdown: 语音反馈和翻译增强

**Feature**: 语音反馈和翻译增强  
**Created**: 2025-10-19  
**Branch**: `001-enhance-voice-feedback`

## Implementation Strategy

This feature will enhance the WordPet application by adding:
1. Word pronunciation on click
2. Sound effects for correct answers
3. Translation display after correct answers

The implementation follows a phased approach starting with the highest priority user story and building incrementally. We will maintain the lightweight architecture and ensure offline functionality.

## Dependencies

User stories are prioritized as follows:
- User Story 1 (P1) - Click word pronunciation: Foundation for all audio functionality
- User Story 2 (P1) - Correct answer sound effects: Builds on audio system from US1
- User Story 3 (P2) - Translation display: Can be implemented in parallel with audio features

## Parallel Execution Examples

- T005-T009 (audio system) can run in parallel with T010-T014 (translation system)
- CSS styling tasks (T020, T025) can run in parallel with JavaScript functionality tasks
- Unit tests can be developed alongside implementation tasks

## Phase 1: Setup (Project Initialization)

- [ ] T001 Create/update git branch for feature development
- [ ] T002 Set up audio assets directory structure in /assets/audio
- [ ] T003 Verify Web Speech API compatibility in target browsers

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

- [ ] T004 [P] Implement TTS utility functions in utils.js for word pronunciation
- [ ] T005 [P] Implement audio concurrency management (queuing/cancellation) in utils.js
- [ ] T006 [P] Enhance sentence data model with translation field in data.js
- [ ] T007 [P] Add TTSConfig settings structure to app state in utils.js
- [ ] T008 [P] Create UserInteractionState for managing audio states in utils.js
- [ ] T009 Test foundational audio API functionality

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - 点击单词发音 (Priority: P1)

**Goal**: Child clicks on a word tile and hears the word pronounced with clear audio.

**Independent Test**: Child clicks on a word tile and hears the word pronounced with clear audio.

- [ ] T010 [US1] Update word tile click handler in game.js to trigger pronunciation
- [ ] T011 [US1] Implement TTS call when word is clicked using Web Speech API
- [ ] T012 [US1] Apply TTS settings (volume/rate/pitch) when pronouncing words
- [ ] T013 [US1] Ensure rapid clicks are queued to prevent audio overlap (FR-007)
- [ ] T014 [US1] Add audio cancellation when new pronunciation is triggered
- [ ] T015 [US1] Implement fallback when TTS is disabled in settings
- [ ] T016 [US1] Add appropriate UI feedback during pronunciation
- [ ] T017 [US1] Test pronunciation timing (response within 0.5 seconds - SC-001)

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - 正确答案的声音特效 (Priority: P1)

**Goal**: Child receives audio feedback when they successfully complete a sentence.

**Independent Test**: Child receives pleasant sound effect when they successfully complete a sentence.

- [ ] T018 [US2] Implement sound effect selection for correct answers
- [ ] T019 [US2] Add sound effect playback in sentence validation logic in game.js
- [ ] T020 [US2] Add CSS styling for success feedback to accompany sound effects
- [ ] T021 [US2] Ensure sound effect does not interfere with TTS feedback (FR-007)
- [ ] T022 [US2] Test sound timing (plays within 1 second - SC-002)
- [ ] T023 [US2] Implement fallback when device sound is disabled
- [ ] T024 [US2] Test that sound effects enhance engagement without distraction

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - 正确答案后的翻译显示 (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Child sees a translation of the sentence they just completed after getting the answer right.

**Independent Test**: Child sees a translation of the sentence they just completed after getting the answer right.

- [ ] T025 [US3] Add translation display UI element in game interface
- [ ] T026 [US3] Implement translation lookup after correct sentence validation
- [ ] T027 [US3] Add CSS styling for translation display below sentence
- [ ] T028 [US3] Ensure translation appears within 1 second (SC-003)
- [ ] T029 [US3] Implement fallback when translation is not available (FR-008)
- [ ] T030 [US3] Make sure translation is child-friendly and age-appropriate (FR-006)
- [ ] T031 [US3] Test offline translation availability
- [ ] T032 [US3] Validate translation display doesn't interfere with gameplay

## Phase 6: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

- [ ] T033 Add error handling for Web Speech API failures
- [ ] T034 Test performance on low-end devices (SC-006)
- [ ] T035 Verify offline functionality works as specified (FR-005)
- [ ] T036 Add settings UI controls for TTS preferences
- [ ] T037 Test audio concurrency management edge cases
- [ ] T038 Verify features don't significantly impact app bundle size
- [ ] T039 Test cross-browser compatibility
- [ ] T040 Conduct final end-to-end testing of all features
- [ ] T041 Update documentation with new features
- [ ] T042 Create automated tests for new functionality
