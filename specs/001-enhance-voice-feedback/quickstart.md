# Quickstart Guide: 语音反馈和翻译增强

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Modern web browser with Web Speech API support (Chrome, Edge, Safari - Firefox has limited support)
- Text editor or IDE
- No additional build tools required (vanilla HTML/CSS/JS implementation)

### Getting Started
1. Ensure you have the base WordPet application files
2. Review the enhanced requirements in spec.md
3. Test Web Speech API functionality in your target browsers
4. Implement changes following the task order in the next section

## Key Implementation Areas

### 1. Word Pronunciation Feature
- Modify `game.js` to handle word click events
- Integrate with Web Speech API via `utils.js`
- Implement audio queuing to prevent overlap (FR-007)
- Add settings management for TTS preferences

### 2. Sound Effects for Correct Answers
- Add sound effect playback in sentence validation logic
- Ensure sound effects don't interfere with TTS feedback (FR-007)
- Implement fallback audio if Web Audio API is unavailable

### 3. Translation Display
- Add translation display in sentence completion feedback
- Implement translation data storage/caching mechanism
- Add fallback behavior when translations are unavailable (FR-008)

### 4. Settings Integration
- Add TTS enable/disable toggle in settings UI
- Add volume control for pronunciation
- Persist settings in LocalStorage

## Testing Locally

### Audio Functionality
1. Test word pronunciation by clicking on words during sentence practice
2. Verify TTS respects user settings (volume, enabled/disabled)
3. Test rapid clicking to ensure audio doesn't overlap
4. Verify sound effects play on correct answers

### Translation Display
1. Complete a sentence and verify translation appears below
2. Test with sentences that have and don't have translations
3. Verify translation display timing (within 1 second per SC-003)

### Offline Functionality
1. Test with network disconnected
2. Verify word pronunciation still works (using Web Speech API)
3. Verify appropriate fallback when translation service unavailable

## API Endpoints (None Required)
The voice feedback and translation features use browser APIs (Web Speech API) and require no server-side endpoints.

## Common Tasks

### Adding Pronunciation Support to Words
1. Modify click handlers in game.js to detect word clicks
2. Call TTS utility function with word text
3. Implement queuing mechanism to handle rapid clicks

### Adding Sound Effects
1. Identify correct answer validation points in game.js
2. Add audio playback for success states
3. Ensure appropriate volume levels

### Implementing Translation Display
1. Modify correct answer feedback in game.js
2. Add translation lookup mechanism
3. Create UI elements for translation display
4. Add CSS for translation styling in style.css

## Performance Considerations

- Monitor for audio overlap issues (FR-007)
- Test on low-end devices to ensure performance (SC-006)
- Verify that features don't significantly impact app bundle size
- Test smoothness of animations and transitions
