**Feature Branch**: `001-enhance-voice-feedback`  
**Created**: 2025-10-19  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "我现在需要提升用户体验，在游戏时，点击每个单词卡片的时候，能自动播放发音。回答正确之后，给出的提示，也需要有一些声音特效。回答正确后，也需要翻译证据话，并显示句子下方。文明文档尽量是中文"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - 点击单词发音 (Priority: P1)

As a 6-12 year old child, I want to hear the pronunciation of each word when I click on it during sentence practice so that I can learn correct pronunciation and improve my listening skills.

**Why this priority**: This directly supports the core learning mechanism by providing instant auditory feedback that helps children learn correct pronunciation of individual words.

**Independent Test**: Child clicks on a word tile and hears the word pronounced with clear audio.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** child is on the sentence puzzle screen with scrambled words, **When** child clicks on a word tile, **Then** the system plays the pronunciation of that word using text-to-speech technology
2. **Given** TTS is enabled in settings, **When** child clicks on a word, **Then** pronunciation plays at an appropriate volume and speed for children
3. **Given** TTS is disabled in settings, **When** child clicks on a word, **Then** no audio plays but visual feedback still occurs

### User Story 2 - 正确答案的声音特效 (Priority: P1)

As a 6-12 year old child, I want to hear pleasant sound effects when I answer correctly so that I feel rewarded and motivated to continue learning.

**Why this priority**: Sound effects provide immediate positive reinforcement which enhances the gamified engagement aspect of WordPet.

**Independent Test**: Child receives audio feedback when they successfully complete a sentence.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** child has arranged all words correctly to form a sentence, **When** system validates the correct answer, **Then** a pleasant sound effect plays in addition to the text feedback message
2. **Given** child answers correctly, **When** positive feedback is displayed, **Then** sound effect does not interfere with TTS reading of feedback message
3. **Given** sound is disabled in device settings, **When** child answers correctly, **Then** visual feedback still clearly indicates success

### User Story 3 - 正确答案后的翻译显示 (Priority: P2)

As a child learning English, I want to see a translation of the sentence below the words after answering correctly so that I understand the meaning of the sentence I just formed.

**Why this priority**: Translation support helps children understand meaning and context, especially for ESL learners, enhancing the learning experience.

**Independent Test**: Child sees a translation of the sentence they just completed after getting the answer right.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** child has correctly formed a sentence, **When** confirmation message appears, **Then** a translation in child-friendly language appears below the sentence
2. **Given** translation is available for the sentence, **When** child views the translation, **Then** it is clear and age-appropriate
3. **Given** translation is not available for a sentence, **When** child completes it correctly, **Then** no translation section is shown but other feedback remains

### Edge Cases

- What happens if multiple words are clicked rapidly - do all pronunciations play or does the system queue them?
- How does the system handle pronunciation in different languages or dialects?
- What if the browser's text-to-speech engine is not available or fails to load?
- How does the system handle multiple correct answer sound effects playing simultaneously?
- What if translation service is unavailable - does the core functionality still work?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST play pronunciation of individual words when clicked using web speech API during sentence practice
- **FR-002**: System MUST play a pleasant sound effect when child correctly completes a sentence
- **FR-003**: System MUST display a translation of the completed sentence below the word tiles after correct answer validation
- **FR-004**: System MUST respect user's TTS settings (volume, enabled/disabled) when playing pronunciation of words
- **FR-005**: System MUST work offline without internet connection relying on browser's built-in speech synthesis
- **FR-006**: Translation display MUST be child-friendly and age-appropriate
- **FR-007**: Sound effects and word pronunciation MUST NOT overlap or interfere with each other
- **FR-008**: System MUST continue to function if translation service is unavailable, only disabling translation display

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Word**: Individual vocabulary unit with text content that can be pronounced
