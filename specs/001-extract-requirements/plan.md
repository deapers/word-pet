# Implementation Plan: Extract Requirements from WordPet Spec

**Branch**: `001-extract-requirements` | **Date**: 2025-10-18 | **Spec**: /Users/ping/Documents/code/cc-sdd-wordpet/specs/001-extract-requirements/spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Implementation of the core WordPet functionality based on the specification from wordpet.spec.md. The feature involves creating an educational game for 6-12 year old children with sentence拼接 (jigsaw) mechanics, virtual pet growth, and mistake bag system. The implementation follows a lightweight, single HTML page architecture with offline capability and child-first design.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)  
**Primary Dependencies**: None (vanilla web technologies)  
**Storage**: LocalStorage for persistence  
**Testing**: Manual testing with potential for automated UI tests in future  
**Target Platform**: Web browsers (PWA-compatible) supporting modern web standards
**Project Type**: Single-page application (SPA)  
**Performance Goals**: Smooth animations and responsive interactions on mobile devices, <100ms response to user actions
**Constraints**: <1MB total bundle size, offline functionality, child-safe UI interactions  
**Scale/Scope**: Single HTML file implementation with embedded CSS/JS, designed for 6-12 year old users

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

Constitution alignment verification:
- Child-First Design: Implementation must prioritize cognitive and motor skills of 6-12 year olds ✓ RESOLVED
- Low-Friction Learning: Ensure mistakes are not punitive, with positive reinforcement mechanisms ✓ RESOLVED
- Lightweight Architecture: Single HTML page with embedded JS/CSS, no external dependencies ✓ RESOLVED
- Gamified Engagement: Verify game mechanics support sentence拼接, pet growth, and reward systems ✓ RESOLVED
- Responsible Usage: Confirm daily stamina limits and parental controls are implemented ✓ RESOLVED

All constitution checks have been verified and resolved through the research phase. The implementation approach aligns with all core principles of the WordPet constitution.

### Source Code (repository root)

```
# WordPet Project Structure (Single HTML5 Page)
index.html              # Single page framework
style.css              # Styling and animations
game.js                # Core game logic
data.js                # Sentence library and mistake data
pet.js                 # Pet growth logic
utils.js               # Reward calculations, stamina management, TTS
```

**Structure Decision**: The WordPet project will follow a single HTML file architecture with embedded CSS/JS to align with the Lightweight Architecture principle from the constitution. The code is modularized into separate JavaScript files for maintainability while being bundled into a single file for distribution.

## Phase Completion Status

### Phase 0: Outline & Research
- [x] Extract unknowns from Technical Context
- [x] Generate research findings in `research.md`
- [x] Resolve all NEEDS CLARIFICATION items
- [x] Document technology decisions and rationale

### Phase 1: Design & Contracts  
- [x] Extract entities and create `data-model.md`
- [x] Generate API contracts in `/contracts/` 
- [x] Create `quickstart.md` guide
- [x] Update agent context with `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh`

## Next Steps

The implementation plan is complete and ready for Phase 2 (Task Generation) using `/speckit.tasks`. The generated artifacts include:

- `research.md` - Technical decisions and implementation approaches
- `data-model.md` - Detailed data structure definitions
- `quickstart.md` - Development and testing guide
- `/contracts/` - API contract definitions (empty for client-only app)
- Agent context updated with relevant technologies
