# Feature Specification: [FEATURE NAME]

**Feature Branch**: `[###-feature-name]`  
**Created**: [DATE]  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "$ARGUMENTS"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.
  
  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  All stories must align with WordPet's Core Principles: Child-First Design, Low-Friction Learning, Lightweight Architecture, Gamified Engagement, and Responsible Usage.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - Child Sentence Practice (Priority: P1)

As a 6-12 year old child, I want to practice forming sentences by dragging and arranging words so that I can improve my language skills while having fun.

**Why this priority**: This is the core learning mechanism of WordPet - the sentence拼接 game that engages children in language learning.

**Independent Test**: Child can successfully drag words to form a sentence and receive positive feedback when correct, with gentle encouragement when incorrect.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a scrambled sentence with 3-5 words displayed on screen, **When** child drags words to correct positions, **Then** sentence is marked as correct and child receives coins and experience points
2. **Given** a scrambled sentence with 3-5 words displayed on screen, **When** child arranges words incorrectly, **Then** sentence is marked as incorrect but child still receives minimal reward and sentence is added to mistake bag

### User Story 2 - Pet Growth and Rewards (Priority: P2)

As a child, I want to see my virtual pet grow and unlock new features when I practice correctly so that I'm motivated to continue learning.

**Why this priority**: The gamification element is essential to maintain long-term engagement and motivation for learning.

**Independent Test**: Child receives visible pet growth (level up, new decorations) and rewards (coins, animations) when they successfully complete sentence exercises.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** child has accumulated sufficient experience points, **When** experience threshold is reached, **Then** pet level increases with visual animation

---

### User Story 3 - Mistake Review System (Priority: P3)

As a child or parent, I want to review sentences I've struggled with so that I can improve in areas where I need more practice.

**Why this priority**: The learning reinforcement mechanism helps children overcome specific difficulties and builds mastery.

**Independent Test**: Child can revisit previously incorrect sentences and successfully complete them to improve their mastery score.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** child has incorrect sentences in mistake bag, **When** child accesses review mode, **Then** can practice these specific sentences with extra rewards
2. **Given** child successfully answers a mistake bag sentence multiple times, **When** mastery threshold is reached (>=0.8), **Then** sentence is removed from mistake bag

### Edge Cases

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right edge cases.
  Remember to consider child users and ensure all scenarios follow Low-Friction Learning principle.
-->

- What happens when child's stamina reaches zero but they want to continue playing?
- How does system handle offline usage and sync progress when connection returns?
- What if child accidentally closes browser - is progress saved automatically?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: All requirements must align with WordPet's Core Constitution:
  - Child-First Design
  - Low-Friction Learning  
  - Lightweight Architecture
  - Gamified Engagement
  - Responsible Usage
-->

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST implement drag-and-drop interface with large touch targets suitable for children's motor skills
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide non-punitive feedback when answers are incorrect, with minimal rewards to maintain engagement
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to play offline without internet connection, with progress saved in browser storage
- **FR-004**: System MUST persist learning progress, pet status, and coins using LocalStorage
- **FR-005**: System MUST include stamina limitations to prevent overuse and encourage periodic engagement

*Example of marking unclear requirements:*

- **FR-006**: System MUST support [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific accessibility requirements for children with disabilities]
- **FR-007**: System MUST retain user data for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific data retention policies needed for children's privacy]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Player**: Represents the child's profile including level, coins, and stamina
- **Pet**: Virtual pet with level, experience, and decorative items 
- **Sentence**: Language learning unit with text content and mastery score
- **MistakeBag**: Collection of sentences the child has answered incorrectly, with tracking for review

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Define measurable success criteria.
  These must align with WordPet's core mission of child-friendly learning.
  These must be technology-agnostic and measurable.
-->

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Child can successfully complete a sentence拼接 exercise within 2 minutes on first attempt
- **SC-002**: System maintains smooth animations and interactions on devices with limited processing power
- **SC-003**: At least 80% of attempted sentences result in positive reinforcement (correct answers or minimal rewards for incorrect answers)
- **SC-004**: Learning progress is reliably preserved across browser sessions and device restarts
