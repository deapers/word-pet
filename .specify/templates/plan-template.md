# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)  
**Primary Dependencies**: None (vanilla web technologies)  
**Storage**: LocalStorage for persistence  
**Testing**: Manual testing with potential for automated UI tests in future  
**Target Platform**: Web browsers (PWA-compatible) supporting modern web standards
**Project Type**: Single-page application (SPA)  
**Performance Goals**: Smooth animations and responsive interactions on mobile devices, <100ms response to user actions
**Constraints**: <1MB total bundle size, offline functionality, child-safe UI interactions  
**Scale/Scope**: Single HTML file implementation with embedded CSS/JS, designed for 6-12 year old users

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

Constitution alignment verification:
- Child-First Design: Implementation must prioritize cognitive and motor skills of 6-12 year olds
- Low-Friction Learning: Ensure mistakes are not punitive, with positive reinforcement mechanisms
- Lightweight Architecture: Single HTML page with embedded JS/CSS, no external dependencies
- Gamified Engagement: Verify game mechanics support sentence拼接, pet growth, and reward systems
- Responsible Usage: Confirm daily stamina limits and parental controls are implemented

## Complexity Tracking

*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
